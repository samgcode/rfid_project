startup: browser, fullscreen
add error handling frontend
- every request has handling
home page waiting for scanner
- if backend shuts down after already running

when you scan a card it wakes up screen

why does it run on the port you set and the one above webpack
docker compose mongo restart: always

add mongo logs
copy with gzip
add myself to docker group

auto/remotely/easily update symptoms

can we see if usb is plugged in
add pop up 

what if they want to change name

non mandatory:
error if backend isnt running and press button to export
shutdown properly with button

later stuff:
teachers check in and out multiple tiems throughout day
back in x minutes input
visitor check in

questions:
what if the symptoms change/ how often
- how to chage the symptoms
should it be easy to shut down/how easy
